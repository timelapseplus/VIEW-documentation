# Firmware Update

The VIEW Intervalometer can be updated on its own -- no computer is necessary, just a wifi access point for Internet access.

The firmware is loaded directly from github releases, so you can also browse the available firmware here: <a href='https://github.com/timelapseplus/VIEW/releases/' target='_blank'>github.com/timelapseplus/VIEW/releases/</a>

The current firmware version is displayed on the top line of the screen on the VIEW when a camera is not connected.  It can also be found in Information->System Info.

## Update via Wifi

This is usually the easiest method, provided a wireless internet connection is available.  Note that the VIEW is not able to log into captive portals (such as hotel wifi where you need to log in with a room number), so in that case the SD card method below can be used.

### Step 1: Connect the VIEW to the internet

The VIEW must first be connected to the Internet.  Follow these to connect to a WiFi access point for Internet access:

1. Enable WiFi (if it's not already): Settings -> Wireless Setup -> Enable Wifi
2. Connect to a nearby access point: Settings -> Wireless Setup -> Connect to Network
3. Enter the password for the network if necessary (make sure it's entered correctly with the correct case).  Use the context button on the lower right to switch between uppercase/lowercase/numbers/symbols.  Press the power button on the password screen for more instructions.

You can ignore any prompts to enter a code -- just press the cancel button.

### Step 2: Update firmware

Next, navigate to Settings -> Software Version.  If it's successfully connected to the Internet, it will delay a few seconds while it retreives the latest firmware information.  If it's not connected to the Internet, it will only show the previously installed versions (this is so you can always roll back, even when there's no Internet available).  If it just loads the installed versions, return to step 1 above and verify the network password is correct or try a different access point.

Once the Software Version menu has loaded, you can select the firmware version to install.  Press the power button to read the release notes for the selected version.  Press the knob or the enter button to install the selected version.  Updating to the most recent version is always recommended.

The installation will take between 5 and 30 minutes, depending on the connection quality.  Upon success, the system wil reload, displaying the boot splash screen.  If it fails, it will return to the Software Versions menu (better feedback in the UI will be added for this in the future).

Firmware updates will either fail or succeed -- it won't get stuck in a corrupted state.  That said, it's possible for it to hang when downloading if there's a network interruption (working on fixing this).  If after 15 minutes or so the VIEW still says it's downloading the firmware, it may need a force-restart.  Hold the power button for fifteen seconds to power down, then 2 seconds to boot it back up.  It will load the old firmware version, and then you can try again to update.  A future update will provide better error handling & reporting and progress reporting (like a progress bar for the download).

## Update via SD Card

<aside class="notice">This method only works if firmware v1.7.0 or newer has been installed.  After updating to v1.7.0 or newer, it's possible to install older versions and still have the SD card update method work.</aside>

1. Using a computer with internet access, download the latest firmware source code zip file from the releases page here: <a href='https://github.com/timelapseplus/VIEW/releases/' target='_blank'>github.com/timelapseplus/VIEW/releases/</a>
2. Copy the downloaded zip file to the root folder of an SD card (it doesn't need to be empty, it just needs enough space for the zip file).  Do not rename the zip file -- the name is used by the VIEW for recognizing the firmware and version.
3. Insert the SD card with the zip file into the VIEW.
4. On the VIEW, go to Settings->Software Version->Install from SD card to begin installation.  If there is more than one firmware zip file on the SD card, it will automatically select the most recent version.

## Recovery Method

If for some reason the system is corrupted and the VIEW will not boot past the splash screen, the system can likely be restored with the following steps:

1. download a firmware zip file from <a href='https://github.com/timelapseplus/VIEW/releases/' target='_blank'>github.com/timelapseplus/VIEW/releases/</a> and save it to the root folder of an SD card
    <aside class="notice">Important: the file needs to be the original name and still be a zip file, not an extracted folder.  If you download it multiple times, be sure to remove the added " (2)" or anything like that.  Safari unzips downloads automatically, so you'll need to use a browser other than Safari.</aside>

2. force power off the VIEW by holding the power button for 15 seconds until the red light turns off
3. insert the SD card with the firmware file into the VIEW
4. power on the VIEW by pressing the power button for two seconds
5. within a couple seconds of power on, press and hold the enter (middle right) button for about 20 seconds until the splash screen appears

At the bottom of the screen it should say "Updating...".  After a few minutes, it should be restored.
