<p>This document is formatted for printing, and can be printed as a PDF for a portable copy.</p>

          <h1 id="overview-and-operation">Overview and Operation</h1>

<h2 id="power-and-buttons">Power and Buttons</h2>

<p><img alt="Front Overview" src="images/view-overview-front.png" /></p>

<h3 id="power-on">Power On</h3>

<p>To power on the VIEW, press and hold the Power button <code class="prettyprint">(#1)</code> for 2 seconds.  In a few seconds the button will illuminate red, indicating that it&rsquo;s booting.  The VIEW logo will appear on the screen shortly thereafter. </p>

<h3 id="power-off">Power Off</h3>

<p>To power off the VIEW, press and hold the Power button <code class="prettyprint">(#1)</code> for 2 seconds.  A confirmation prompt will appear on the screen.  Turn the knob to select &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; and 
press the knob or the Enter button <code class="prettyprint">(#5)</code> to power off.</p>

<p>If the VIEW is not responsive, it can be forced off by pressing holding the Power button <code class="prettyprint">(#1)</code> for 15 seconds.  It can then be booted normally by pressing the Power button again for 2 seconds.</p>

<h3 id="operation">Operation</h3>

<p>The user interface for the VIEW is a menu based system designed to be simple to operate outdoors and with gloves.  For that reason, there&rsquo;s no touchscreen, but rather simple buttons and a knob for scrolling through options.  Use the knob to scroll up and down through the menus.  To select open or select the highlighted menu item, press the knob or the Enter button <code class="prettyprint">(#5)</code>.  To go back or cancel, press the Cancel button <code class="prettyprint">(#4)</code>.  Some screens use the Context <code class="prettyprint">(#6)</code> button for additional options indicated on the screen.</p>

<aside class="success">Every menu item has an accompanying help screen &ndash; press the Power button (#1) to activated for the current selection.  Power the Power button (#1) or the Cancel button (#4) to exit the help screen.</aside>

<h3 id="gesture-sensor">Gesture Sensor</h3>

<p>The Gesture Sensor <code class="prettyprint">(#2)</code> while a time-lapse is running and the screen goes blank.  Wave your hand across the front to activate, then wave to the right to preview the current/last time-lapse, or to the left to cancel.  While the preview is playing, wave to the right to skip ahead 10 seconds.</p>

<h2 id="ports-and-connections">Ports and Connections</h2>

<p><img alt="Front Overview" src="images/view-overview-side.png" /></p>

<h3 id="charging">Charging</h3>

<p>To charge the VIEW, connect a Micro-B USB cable from a USB power supply (USB charger, battery pack or computer) to the charging port <code class="prettyprint">(#12)</code> on the VIEW.  When connected the Charge Indicator <code class="prettyprint">(#11)</code> will illuminate red, blinking while charging, and steady when full.  This light can be disabled in Settings-&gt;Charge Indicator.  Note that the battery indicator in the VIEW will prematurely show a low battery, and if charging a completely dead battery, it can take some time before progress becomes visible.</p>

<h3 id="auxiliary-ports">Auxiliary Ports</h3>

<p>The VIEW includes two 2.5mm TRS auxiliary ports <code class="prettyprint">(#9, #10)</code> for motion sync, shutter cable triggering and external integrations.  Currently only AUX2 is used by the firmware.  It will send a pulse to trigger motion systems to move after each shot during a time-lapse (no setup necessary for this), or it can be used as an external trigger for the interval when the time-lapse interval is set to &ldquo;External&rdquo;.</p>

<h3 id="sd-card">SD Card</h3>

<p>The SD card slot <code class="prettyprint">(#8)</code> provides a convenient way to get data from the VIEW.  The VIEW can also save the RAW time-lapse images to the SD card &ndash; this is the most convenient way for post processing, since each time-lapse is named sequentially in its own folder along with the XMP files for automatic deflickering in Lightroom.</p>

<p>The VIEW supports all current SD card types and capacities, but internally it uses a Class 10 controller, so the newest UHS II cards will not offer a speed improvement over a Class 10 card.  Cards can be formatted with the camera or on a computer as FAT/EXFAT (MSDOS).</p>

<h3 id="usb-host">USB Host</h3>

<p>The VIEW includes a full-size USB host port <code class="prettyprint">(#13)</code> for connecting the camera.  This port also supports USB hubs for connecting multiple devices (right now it can also communicate with the DP NMX via USB, and multiple camera support is planned for the future).</p>

<h2 id="hooking-up-the-camera">Hooking up the camera</h2>

<h3 id="hotshoe-mount">Hotshoe Mount</h3>

<p>The VIEW can be conveniently connected to the top of the camera by sliding it on the camera&rsquo;s hotshoe.  This also provides PC-sync feedback for bulb ramping without requiring an additional cable, however, the current exposure ramping mode does not use this, so you can mount the VIEW anywhere without affecting the performance.</p>

<h3 id="usb-connection">USB Connection</h3>

<p>Connect the appropriate USB cable for your camera from the Host Port <code class="prettyprint">(#13)</code> to your camera&rsquo;s USB port.  It&rsquo;s best to have the camera powered on before connecting, as there seems to be an occasional timing issue causing the camera to not properly connect if powered on while connected.  If the camera doesn&rsquo;t seem to connect, unplug the USB and reconnect.  Sony cameras can be quite flaky &ndash; if you&rsquo;re having trouble, try removing the battery from the camera, powering it back on, and then plugging in the USB to the VIEW again.</p>

<p>Some cameras need to be set to &ldquo;PC Connect&rdquo; or &ldquo;PTP Mode&rdquo; in order for USB to function properly.  Also, some Canon cameras with WiFi (like the 6D) require WiFi to be disabled for USB control to work.</p>

<p>Only the USB cable is needed for full ramping support.  No other connections are necessary.</p>

          <h1 id="time-lapse-setup">Time-lapse Setup</h1>

<p>Start by connecting the camera via USB as described in the previous section.  This will enable the Time-lapse menu (the first item on the main screen).  Press the knob or enter button to select.  You&rsquo;ll then see the options listed in this section.</p>

<aside class="notice">IMPORTANT: the camera must be in manual mode, set to capture in RAW (not RAW+JPEG)</aside>

<h3 id="quick-setup-for-the-first-test">Quick Setup for the first test</h3>

<p>For your first automatic ramping test, I recommend to start with the following configuration:</p>

<table><thead>
<tr>
<th>Setting</th>
<th>Recommended Value</th>
</tr>
</thead><tbody>
<tr>
<td>Exposure</td>
<td>Just setup the camera for the current scene before hand and skip this step</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Timelapse Mode</td>
<td>Auto Ramping</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Interval Mode</td>
<td>Auto Variable</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Day Interval</td>
<td>8 seconds</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Night Interval</td>
<td>40 Seconds</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Destination</td>
<td>Camera <sup>1</sup></td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>I recommend starting an hour before sunset, setting the camera at the lowest ISO, a moderately wide aperture (f/2.8) and then setting the shutter speed to whatever is needed for a good exposure (maybe 1/3200).  Make sure it&rsquo;s not overexposed!</p>

<p>Then, let it run at least 3 hours after sunset to get a good length and transition.  Or, if you have external power for the camera, go all night until sunrise!</p>

<p>Once the time-lapse is complete, check out the <a href="#post-processing">post-processing</a> section.</p>

<p><sup>1</sup>For Sony cameras connected via USB, you&rsquo;ll need to set this to &lsquo;SD Card&rsquo; and make sure an SD card is in the VIEW.  For other cameras, performance is best when saving directly to the camera.  Sony can save to the camera when connected via WiFi instead of USB (see <a href="#camera-specific-notes">camera-specific notes</a> for more).</p>

<h3 id="time-lapse-options-are-described-below">Time-lapse options are described below</h3>

<h2 id="exposure">Exposure</h2>

<p>Puts the camera in liveview mode for adjusting the exposure and focus. Turn the knob to increase/decrease exposure.  Press the enter button to toggle focus mode.  When in focus mode, the liveview image will be cropped to 100%, and the knob will then adjust focus rather than exposure.*</p>

<aside class="notice">NOTE: the Exposure feature may not work well on all cameras.  If you have any trouble with it, simply adjust the exposure and focus on the camera before connecting the VIEW.</aside>

<aside class="success">Whether setup via the Exposure menu or in camera, the starting exposure for ramping is very important as it is used for a reference throughout the time-lapse.  Make sure it is not over-exposed, as excessive clipped (overexposed highlights) regions of the image can cause the exposure ramping to be inaccurate.</aside>

<h2 id="timelapse-mode">Timelapse Mode</h2>

<table><thead>
<tr>
<th>Option</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
</thead><tbody>
<tr>
<td>Fixed</td>
<td>This is for a basic time-lapse where the exposure and interval are constant throughout</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Auto Ramping</td>
<td>In this mode the VIEW will automatically adjust the exposure to match changing light conditions</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>For short time-lapse clips during the day or night where the exposure and interval are constant, choose Fixed.</p>

<p>For sunsets, sunrises, day to night, night to day, and day to night to day, choose Auto Ramping.  This will also enable the Auto Interval options for interval ramping between day and night.</p>

<h2 id="primary-camera">Primary Camera</h2>

<p>This option is only shown when more than one camera is connected to the VIEW.  The primary camera selection defines the camera used for setup and liveview, the status thumbnail, and the exposure tracking.  The settings from the primary camera are copied to all additional cameras connected, and they are triggered in sync.  This is nice for panoramas, as well as a wide view and a telephoto view for post-processing transitions.  In the case of wide and telephoto, make the wide view the primary for better exposure tracking.</p>

<h2 id="interval-mode">Interval Mode</h2>

<p>This option is only shown when Timelapse Mode is set to &#39;Auto Ramping&rsquo;</p>

<table><thead>
<tr>
<th>Option</th>
<th>Description</th>

</thead><tbody>
<tr>
<td>Fixed Length</td>
<td>This maintains the same interval through out the time-lapse and will limit the maximum shutter speed to fit within it</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Auto Variable</td>
<td>This mode will automatically ramp between a Day Interval and a Night Interval and allows for longer shutter speeds at night</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>

<h2 id="interval">Interval</h2>

<p>This option is only shown when Timelapse Mode is set to &#39;Fixed&rsquo; or Interval Mode is set to &#39;Fixed&rsquo;</p>

<table><thead>
<tr>
<th>Option</th>

<h2 id="day-interval">Day Interval</h2>

<p>This option is only shown when Timelapse Mode is set to &#39;Auto Ramping&rsquo; and Interval Mode is set to &#39;Auto Variable&rsquo;</p>

<p>This determines the interval length during daylight, based on the camera&rsquo;s exposure settings.  It will be smoothly ramped to/from the Night Interval as the ambient conditions (and camera exposure) change.</p>

<p>This option is only shown when Timelapse Mode is set to &#39;Auto Ramping&rsquo; and Interval Mode is set to &#39;Auto Variable&rsquo;</p>

<p>This determines the interval length during the night, based on the camera&rsquo;s exposure settings.  It will be smoothly ramped to/from the Day Interval as the ambient conditions (and camera exposure) change.</p>

<h2 id="ramping-options">Ramping Options</h2>

<p>This option is only shown when Timelapse Mode is set to &#39;Auto Ramping&rsquo;.</p>

<p>In this menu, there are a few settings to configuring the limits of auto ramping.  Note that these options can limit the range of ramping and thereby cause it to not reach a proper exposure if too limited.  For most cameras, a max ISO of 6400 does well, with a lower ISO limit of 100 (best to only use native ISOs, not lower).</p>

<p>The Night Exposure setting defines how much less exposed &ldquo;night&rdquo; should be, relative to &ldquo;day&rdquo;.  For example, a night exposure of -1 (the default), will underexposure a night scene by 1 stop compared to the day.  So, if an auto ramp is started during the day, and by night the exposure it too light, a lower night exposure is needed.  Or, if the images after sunset are too dark, a higher value should be used.  A Night Exposure setting of 0 will keep the day and night perceived luminosity the same.</p>

<p>[1] The PID Luminance is the default and orginal, and the LRTimelapse method was contributed by Gunther Wegner as an alternative method and has been working well since v1.7.8.  The PID Luminance method is multi-layered and tracks the rate of change of average image luminance (with extra weight for clipping) and predicts the expected exposure for the next frame.  It limits the response time to provide smooth transitions and works in both directions (sunset or sunrise) at once.  The LRTimelapse method differs in that it is based on the histogram, simply increasing or decreasing the exposure to maintain a similar histogram and avoid clipping.  This allows for more rapid changes (up to 1/3 stop per frame) and predictable results.  Which is better?  Good question &ndash; if you don&rsquo;t like the results with one, try the other, and let me know your experience at https://www.timelapseplus.com/contact</p>

<p>[2] The &ldquo;balanced&rdquo; option tries to move shutter and ISO together, to more gradually increase the shutter speed.  The other settings always prioritize the lowest ISO possible.</p>

<h2 id="manual-aperture">Manual Aperture</h2>

<p>This option is only shown when the aperture setting of the lens cannot be read from the camera, such as when using a manual lens or the lens-twist method.</p>

<p>Enter the aperture setting of the lens here to aid in the calculation of absolute exposure values to aid in day/night feathering of interval and exposure compensation.</p>

<h2 id="destination">Destination</h2>

<p>This option is only shown when an SD card is inserted in the VIEW.  Sony cameras require that the images be saved to the VIEW&rsquo;s SD card.</p>

<table><thead>
<tr>
<th>Option</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
</thead><tbody>
<tr>
<td>Camera</td>
<td>Keep images on the camera&rsquo;s card.  For auto ramping, XMP files will need to be later saved and merged with the camera files (to be described in the post-processing section coming soon). This is recommended for best performance and shortest intervals.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>SD Card</td>
<td>Saves the time-lapse images in their own folder in the root of the SD card, along side the XMP files for Lightroom.  This simplifies post-processing and organization since the exposure corrections for deflickering will be automatically imported into Lightroom along with the images, but requires longer intervals due to transferring the images over USB.</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>

<h2 id="start">START</h2>

<p>If you have all the settings entered, select this option to start the time-lapse!  While it&rsquo;s running, you can select &ldquo;Preview&rdquo; to review the results in process, or select &ldquo;RUNNING&rdquo; for a cancellation confirmation.  This status screen is still in its most basic state and will be improved in a future release.</p>

          <h1 id="remote-app">Remote App</h1>

<p>The VIEW Intervalometer can be controlled and monitored via a web-based app for mobile devices.  Anything with a web browser can access it, but it&rsquo;s only optimized for mobile-sized screens.  There is no app publish in an app store at this point, rather, it is loaded directly from the VIEW itself.</p>

<p>There are two methods for connecting to the VIEW from a mobile device, a local WiFi method, and an internet method.</p>

<h3 id="local-method-pros">Local Method Pros:</h3>

<ul>
<li>No Internet required, works in remote locations</li>
<li>Low-latency connections, great with streaming liveview during setup</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="local-method-cons">Local Method Cons:</h3>

<ul>
<li>Only works within WiFi range of the VIEW</li>
<li>Internet will not function on the mobile device while connected to the VIEW</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="web-method-pros">Web Method Pros:</h3>

<ul>
<li>Access the VIEW from anywhere in the world!</li>
<li>Mobile device can be connected to the internet as usual</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="web-method-cons">Web Method Cons:</h3>

<ul>
<li>The VIEW needs to be within range of a WiFi access point for internet (you could use a mobile hotspot)</li>
<li>Higher latency so you&rsquo;ll see some lag with liveview</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="local-wifi-method">Local Wifi Method</h2>

<p><img alt="WiFi Setup Diagram" src="images/view-app-wifi.png" /></p>

<p>To configure the local WiFi app interface, setup the following on the VIEW:</p>

<ol>
<li>Enable WiFi (if it&rsquo;s not already): Settings -&gt; Wireless Setup -&gt; Enable Wifi</li>
<li>Enable Access Point Mode: Settings -&gt; Wireless Setup -&gt; Enable built-in AP (if this setting is missing it means it&rsquo;s already enabled)</li>
</ol>

<p>Then, on the mobile device:</p>

<ol>
<li>Connect to the TL+VIEW WiFi access point*</li>
<li>Open a web browser and go to 10.0.0.1</li>
</ol>

<p>That&rsquo;s it &ndash; the app will then load in the browser.  On an iPhone, you can save it to the homescreen for convenient use as a full-screen app.</p>

<p>The name of the built-in access point can be changed under Settings -&gt; Wireless Setup -&gt; Set built-in AP Name.</p>

<ul>
<li>Note: In v1.8 and newer, a password is required.  The default is &ldquo;timelapse+&rdquo; and it can be viewed/changed in Settings-&gt;Wireless Setup-&gt;Set built-in AP Password</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="remote-internet-method">Remote Internet Method</h2>

<p><img alt="Web Setup Diagram" src="images/view-app-web.png" /></p>

<p>To configure the remote web app interface, setup the following on the VIEW:</p>

<ol>
<li>Enable WiFi (if it&rsquo;s not already): Settings -&gt; Wireless Setup -&gt; Enable Wifi</li>
<li>Connect to a nearby access point: Settings -&gt; Wireless Setup -&gt; Connect to Network</li>
<li>Enter the password for the network if necessary (make sure it&rsquo;s entered correctly with the correct case).  Use the context button on the lower right to switch between uppercase/lowercase/numbers/symbols.  Press the power button on the password screen for more instructions.</li>
<li>Once the VIEW connects (only the first time), a number will appear on the screen.  You&rsquo;ll need this for step 4 below.</li>
</ol>

<p>Then, on the mobile device:</p>

<ol>
<li>Open a web browser and go to app.view.tl</li>
<li>Login using your email address.  If you need to register, you&rsquo;ll be asked to create a subdomain (for access as yoursubdomain.view.tl) and a password</li>
<li>Once logged in, if this is your first time, press &lsquo;Add Device&rsquo; (if you&rsquo;ve done this before, you don&rsquo;t need to again)</li>
<li>Enter the numbers displayed on the VIEW screen</li>
</ol>

<p>That&rsquo;s it &ndash; the app will then load in the browser.  On an iPhone, you can save it to the homescreen for convenient use as a full-screen app.</p>

          <h1 id="firmware-update">Firmware Update</h1>

<p>The VIEW Intervalometer can be updated on its own &ndash; no computer is necessary, just a wifi access point for Internet access.</p>

<p>The firmware is loaded directly from github releases, so you can also browse the available firmware here: <a href='https://github.com/timelapseplus/VIEW/releases/' target='_blank'>github.com/timelapseplus/VIEW/releases/</a></p>

<p>The current firmware version is displayed on the top line of the screen on the VIEW when a camera is not connected.  It can also be found in Information-&gt;System Info.</p>

<h2 id="update-via-wifi">Update via Wifi</h2>

<p>This is usually the easiest method, provided a wireless internet connection is available.  Note that the VIEW is not able to log into captive portals (such as hotel wifi where you need to log in with a room number), so in that case the SD card method below can be used.</p>

<h3 id="step-1-connect-the-view-to-the-internet">Step 1: Connect the VIEW to the internet</h3>

<p>The VIEW must first be connected to the Internet.  Follow these to connect to a WiFi access point for Internet access:</p>

<ol>
<li>Enable WiFi (if it&rsquo;s not already): Settings -&gt; Wireless Setup -&gt; Enable Wifi</li>
<li>Connect to a nearby access point: Settings -&gt; Wireless Setup -&gt; Connect to Network</li>
<li>Enter the password for the network if necessary (make sure it&rsquo;s entered correctly with the correct case).  Use the context button on the lower right to switch between uppercase/lowercase/numbers/symbols.  Press the power button on the password screen for more instructions.</li>
</ol>

<p>You can ignore any prompts to enter a code &ndash; just press the cancel button.</p>

<h3 id="step-2-update-firmware">Step 2: Update firmware</h3>

<p>Next, navigate to Settings -&gt; Software Version.  If it&rsquo;s successfully connected to the Internet, it will delay a few seconds while it retreives the latest firmware information.  If it&rsquo;s not connected to the Internet, it will only show the previously installed versions (this is so you can always roll back, even when there&rsquo;s no Internet available).  If it just loads the installed versions, return to step 1 above and verify the network password is correct or try a different access point.</p>

<p>Once the Software Version menu has loaded, you can select the firmware version to install.  Press the power button to read the release notes for the selected version.  Press the knob or the enter button to install the selected version.  Updating to the most recent version is always recommended.</p>

<p>The installation will take between 5 and 30 minutes, depending on the connection quality.  Upon success, the system wil reload, displaying the boot splash screen.  If it fails, it will return to the Software Versions menu (better feedback in the UI will be added for this in the future).</p>

<p>Firmware updates will either fail or succeed &ndash; it won&rsquo;t get stuck in a corrupted state.  That said, it&rsquo;s possible for it to hang when downloading if there&rsquo;s a network interruption (working on fixing this).  If after 15 minutes or so the VIEW still says it&rsquo;s downloading the firmware, it may need a force-restart.  Hold the power button for fifteen seconds to power down, then 2 seconds to boot it back up.  It will load the old firmware version, and then you can try again to update.  A future update will provide better error handling &amp; reporting and progress reporting (like a progress bar for the download).</p>

<h2 id="update-via-sd-card">Update via SD Card</h2>

<aside class="notice">This method only works if firmware v1.7.0 or newer has been installed.  After updating to v1.7.0 or newer, it&rsquo;s possible to install older versions and still have the SD card update method work.</aside>

<ol>
<li>Using a computer with internet access, download the latest firmware source code zip file from the releases page here: <a href='https://github.com/timelapseplus/VIEW/releases/' target='_blank'>github.com/timelapseplus/VIEW/releases/</a></li>
<li>Copy the downloaded zip file to the root folder of an SD card (it doesn&rsquo;t need to be empty, it just needs enough space for the zip file).  Do not rename the zip file &ndash; the name is used by the VIEW for recognizing the firmware and version.</li>
<li>Insert the SD card with the zip file into the VIEW.</li>
<li>On the VIEW, go to Settings-&gt;Software Version-&gt;Install from SD card to begin installation.  If there is more than one firmware zip file on the SD card, it will automatically select the most recent version.</li>
</ol>

<aside class="notice">If for some reason the system is corrupted and the VIEW will not boot past the splash screen, the system can be restored by holding the power button for 15 seconds to power off, then insert an SD card with the firmware zip file, power on by pressing the power button for 2 seconds, then hold the enter (middle right) button until the &ldquo;Updating&hellip;&rdquo; screen appears.  It will then install the firmware from the card and boot up.</aside>

          <h1 id="camera-specific-notes">Camera-Specific Notes</h1>

<p>This section includes notes and issues specific to certain camera bodies.  Camera-specific issues will be corrected in firmware when possible and removed from this section once resolved.</p>

<h2 id="notes-for-all-cameras">Notes for all cameras</h2>

<ul>
<li>Manual mode</li>
<li>A native ISO setting (not Auto)</li>
<li>Save as RAW (not RAW+JPEG)</li>
<li>Disable any long exposure noise reduction</li>
<li>Focus should be manual or back-button (if the shutter button activates focus it can cause issues)</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s best to disable image stabilization</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="sony-alpha-usb">Sony Alpha (USB)</h2>

<p>Sony cameras can work well, but there are several things that the VIEW currently does not enforce but must be set in the camera for it to work.</p>

<p>There have been reports that not all USB cables work with Sony cameras, so if it fails to connect, try a different USB cable.</p>

<p>Setup the following on the camera:</p>

<ol>
<li>USB Mode set to &lsquo;PC Remote&rsquo;</li>
<li>RAW files (not JPEG or RAW+JPEG)</li>
<li>Manual mode, in a native ISO (not the ISO numbers with a line over them, nor auto ISO)</li>
<li>Focus set to manual (the back button still works for autofocus, but this prevents it from trying to focus on every shot)</li>
</ol>

<p>On the VIEW in the time-lapse setup menu, the Destination must be set to SD card.  Insert an SD card into the VIEW for this option to appear.  This is required because a limitation in the Sony firmware prevents it from being able to save to the camera&rsquo;s card while it&rsquo;s connected via USB.</p>

<p>The Sony A7RII needs longer intervals due to the large file size if using USB.  14 seconds should be good &ndash; shorter might be possible.  Other Sony cameras seem to do ok at 6-8 seconds for a minimum interval.  With the Wifi interface this is not an issue.</p>

<h2 id="sony-alpha-wifi">Sony Alpha (Wifi)</h2>

<p>The best interface for Sony is wifi since it doesn&rsquo;t have the limitations imposed on the USB interface.</p>

<p>To connect the camera via wifi:</p>

<ol>
<li>On the camera, open the &ldquo;Smart Remote Control&rdquo; app (must be updated to the latest version to work!).</li>
<li>The camera will display the wifi information.  Press the &ldquo;delete&rdquo; button on the camera to display the password.</li>
<li>Connect the VIEW&rsquo;s wifi (Settings-&gt;Wireless Setup-&gt;Connect to Network) to the camera&rsquo;s, using the password shown on the camera screen.</li>
<li>The VIEW should show that the camera is connected within a few seconds, and the camera will enable liveview again.</li>
<li>IMPORTANT: press the menu button on the camera and make sure it&rsquo;s set to RAW+JPEG (small).  The setting here does not follow what the camera was previously set to, and RAW only is not an option, but RAW+JPEG (small) works.</li>
</ol>

<p>When using the wifi interface, the time-lapse Destination setting must be set to &ldquo;Camera&rdquo;.  Afterward, you can get the XMPs via the Time-lapse Clips menu.</p>

<p>At present, a limitation with Sony wifi is that since the wifi interface on the VIEW is used for the camera, it&rsquo;s not possible to use the remote app.  It might be possible in the future firmware release to have two wifi interfaces to work around this.</p>

<p>Some Sony cameras allow charging while in use via the USB port.  If this is enabled, the VIEW&rsquo;s battery will drain rather quickly, so external power to the VIEW is recommended.  The VIEW cannot supply enough power to the camera to charge the battery during operation, but it will greatly extend the battery life.  So if you have a full battery in the camera and have a USB power source connected to the VIEW (like a cell phone charging pack), the whole setup should last at least 12 hours before the camera&rsquo;s battery slowly drains.</p>

<h2 id="nikon">Nikon</h2>

<p>Many Nikon cameras have the option of whether liveview displays the simulated exposure or not.  If you are using the exposure menu or liveview via the app, you&rsquo;ll want to make sure the liveview display shows the exposure.  On the D800, this is toggled by a button on the lower-left.  On the D5100 and possible other older/lower-end models, it is not possible to simulate exposure with liveview.  In this case, a test photo can be used via the smartphone app.</p>

<p>Note: some VIEW devices would not connect to the Nikon D800/D800E until firmware version v1.7.5.  Updating to v1.7.5 or newer will fix this.</p>

<h2 id="panasonic">Panasonic</h2>

<p>Make sure the USB mode on the camera is set to PC Tether (for the GH3 &amp; GH4 set it to &ldquo;Remote Control (PTP)&rdquo;), in manual mode, RAW, and single-shot burst mode.  For the GH5, GH5S, and G9, firmware v1.8-beta23 or newer is required for the VIEW.</p>

<h2 id="fuji-x">Fuji X</h2>

<p>Note: Fuji support requires v1.8-beta13 or newer firmware on the VIEW.  It has been tested with the X-T1 and X-T2, but others in the X-series should also work as long as they are compatible with the Pro Tethering plugin for Lightroom.  Make sure the USB mode on the camera is set to PC Auto.  ISO should be manually set to 200 or higher.</p>

<p>Some Fuji cameras allow charging while in use via the USB port.  In this case, the VIEW&rsquo;s battery will drain rather quickly, so external power to the VIEW is recommended.  When testing with a fully charged VIEW and full battery in an X-T2, I was able to get 1200 frames over 4 hours before the VIEW ran out of power (the camera still had battery since it was being charged by the VIEW).  The VIEW cannot supply enough power to the camera to charge the battery during operation, but it will greatly extend the battery life.  So if you have a full battery in the camera and have a USB power source connected to the VIEW (like a cell phone charging pack), the whole setup should last at least 12 hours before the camera&rsquo;s battery slowly drains.</p>

<h2 id="olympus-om-d">Olympus OM-D</h2>

<p>Note: Olympus support requires v1.8-44 or newer firmware on the VIEW.  It has been tested with the E-M1, E-M1 II, and E-M5 II.  Make sure the USB mode on the camera is set to Camera+PC icon.  ISO should be manually set to 200 or higher, with long exposure noise reduction disabled.</p>

          <h1 id="motion-control">Motion Control</h1>

<p>The VIEW is able to synchronize with most motion control systems for shoot-move-shoot functionality.  In addition it has full motion programming support for the Dynamic Perception NMX stepper controller (via Bluetooth or USB) and Syrp Genie Mini (via Bluetooth), with support for the eMotimo Spectrum (via AUX2 serial) and Kessler Second Shooter (likely) planned for the near future.</p>

<h2 id="aux-out-sync">AUX Out Sync</h2>

<p>To trigger a motion system to move after each shot, connect a 2.5mm TRS cable from AUX2 on the VIEW to the sync input on the motion system.  The VIEW will send a 200ms &ldquo;closed&rdquo; pulse after the completion of each shot.  No special setup is required on the VIEW.  The motion system needs to support an external intervalometer input, and usually needs to be in a special mode (e.g., &ldquo;slave&rdquo; mode for the NMX, &ldquo;external intervolometer&rdquo; for eMotimo TB3).</p>

<h2 id="external-trigger">External Trigger</h2>

<p>This is the most versatile option and should work with any system that has a camera trigger for shoot-move-shoot.  This is the only option for systems that don&rsquo;t support an external auxiliary sync (like the Syrp Genie). In this mode, the interval is defined externally by the motion system, and the VIEW works inline between the motion system and the camera to handle the exposure.</p>

<p>To use an external trigger, set the Interval Mode to &lsquo;External AUX2&rsquo; in the time-lapse setup menu.  Connect the motion system&rsquo;s camera port to the VIEW&rsquo;s AUX2 port with a 2.5mm TRS cable (TRRS won&rsquo;t work). The camera is connected to the VIEW&rsquo;s USB port as usual.  Once started, the VIEW will then wait for the signal from the motion system to trigger each frame.</p>

<p>With this configuration, the VIEW handles the exposure and ramping, and the motion and interval is defined by the motion system.  Since the VIEW is not controlling the interval, a variable interval is not possible.</p>

<h2 id="dynamic-perception-nmx">Dynamic Perception NMX</h2>

<p>In addition to the above methods, the NMX controller can be connected via USB or Bluetooth for full motion programming.  Motion programming must be done via the mobile app for the VIEW as it is not currently supported by the standalone interface.</p>

<h3 id="nmx-bluetooth-connection">NMX Bluetooth Connection</h3>

<p><i>Note: for this method, the latest v1.8 beta firmware should be installed on the VIEW.</i>  To connect the NMX via Bluetooth, first enable Bluetooth on the VIEW in Settings-&gt;Wireless Setup-&gt;Enable Bluetooth (if it only shows &ldquo;Disable Bluetooth&rdquo;, then it&rsquo;s already enabled).  Make sure the NMX app is not connected to the NMX, as this will block the VIEW from connecting (turn BT off on the phone if needed).  With Bluetooth enabled, the VIEW will automatically connect to the first available NMX controller when it is powered on.  A small Bluetooth icon will appear in the top bar of the VIEW once connected.  It can then be setup via the VIEW wifi app as show in this video: https://vimeo.com/237150285</p>

<h3 id="nmx-usb-connection">NMX USB Connection</h3>

<p>To connect to the NMX via USB, a USB hub is needed for the additional USB port (one for the camera, one for the NMX).  Connect a small USB hub to the VIEW, then connect the camera and the NMX to the hub, then connect power to the NMX (in this order!).  It&rsquo;s recommended to have BT disabled on both the VIEW and the phone in this case to avoid any issues.  A small Bluetooth icon will appear in the top bar of the VIEW once connected.  It can then be setup via the VIEW wifi app as show in this video: <a href="https://vimeo.com/237150285">https://vimeo.com/237150285</a></p>

<p>USB has the advantage of being more reliable and not affected by cold temperatures.</p>

<p>Important: the NMX must first be connected via USB, then external power &ndash; if the NMX is powered on before connecting USB, it won&rsquo;t be detected.</p>

<h2 id="syrp-genie-mini">Syrp Genie Mini</h2>

<p>The VIEW can fully control the Syrp Genie Mini via Bluetooth, allowing for multi-keyframe motion programming.  The latest v1.8 beta firmware is required on the VIEW, and the Genie Mini should also have its firmware up to date.  Note that when controlling the Genie Mini via the VIEW it will not be possible to use the Syrp app at the same time, so it&rsquo;s best to disable BT on the phone to avoid interference.  </p>

<p>To connect the Genie Mini to the VIEW, first enable Bluetooth on the VIEW in Settings-&gt;Wireless Setup-&gt;Enable Bluetooth (if it only shows &ldquo;Disable Bluetooth&rdquo;, then it&rsquo;s already enabled).  Then power on the Genie Mini and watch for a small Bluetooth icon to appear in the top bar in the VIEW&rsquo;s display.  At present, up to two Genie Minis can be connected at once (like for pan/tilt).  Each one can be then configured in the VIEW&rsquo;s wifi app, similar to the NMX setup show here: <a href="https://vimeo.com/237150285">https://vimeo.com/237150285</a>.  Also see <a href="https://vimeo.com/235979676">https://vimeo.com/235979676</a> for a quick setup without the app.</p>

<p>If preferred, the Genie Mini can also be programmed separately and then synchronized with the VIEW for shoot move shoot functionality.  This is the &ldquo;External Trigger&rdquo; method shown above.  Connect the camera port on the Genie Mini to the AUX2 port in the VIEW with a 2.5mm TRS cable (TRRS will not work) and then set the Interval Mode on the VIEW to &#39;External AUX2&rsquo;.  In this configuration, the VIEW fires each frame when prompted by the Mini while handling ramping, and the Mini manages the motion and interval as defined in the Syrp app.</p>

          <h1 id="post-processing">Post Processing</h1>

<p>As the VIEW changes the exposure for ramping, the changes are made in 1/3 stop steps since finer changes are not possible on the camera.  This causes stepping in the brightness of the time-lapse which can be perceived as flicker and needs correction in post processing.  There are several ways to due this, but most require Adobe Photoshop Lightroom.  In the future I plan to add Darktable support.  There have been many requests for Capture One, but due to their limited support for third party integrations, this likely won&rsquo;t be possible.</p>

<p>Below are a list of post processing methods.  If you&rsquo;re new to it all, I would recommend checking out the Timelapse Workflow plugin.  If you&rsquo;re already using LRTimelapse, stick with that, as the VIEW will integrate nicely into your current workflow.</p>

<h2 id="using-the-timelapse-workflow-plugin">Using the Timelapse Workflow plugin</h2>

<p>For most users, this will be the easiest and quickest post processing option.  No XMP files are needed, and you can edit anything including exposure and the plugin will smooth it all out.  Download and read the documentation here: <a href="https://www.timelapseworkflow.com/documentation.html">https://www.timelapseworkflow.com/documentation.html</a></p>

<p>The Timelapse Workflow Plugin works with Lightroom 6 and newer.</p>

<p>The plugin is free for VIEW users.  Follow the registration instructions for VIEW users here: <a href="https://www.timelapseworkflow.com/documentation.html#registration">https://www.timelapseworkflow.com/documentation.html#registration</a></p>

<h2 id="using-lrtimelapse">Using LRTimelapse</h2>

<p>When using LRTimelapse, XMP files from the VIEW are not needed as LRTimelapse will smoothly blend the exposure changes (although they can be used).  Just follow the standard LRTimelapse workflow as described here: <a href="https://forum.lrtimelapse.com/Thread-using-the-timelapse-view-with-lrtimelapse">https://forum.lrtimelapse.com/Thread-using-the-timelapse-view-with-lrtimelapse</a></p>

<p>When post processing with LRTimelapse, it&rsquo;s ok to adjust the exposure slider, since LRTimelapse will manage the smoothing.</p>

<p>LRTimelapse works with Lightroom as well as Bridge/ACR.</p>

<h2 id="using-xmps-generated-by-the-view">Using XMPs generated by the VIEW</h2>

<p>The VIEW can generate XMP files to provide exposure correction data for Lightroom to eliminate flicker.  This method works with Lightroom as well as Bridge/ACR.</p>

<p>If the images were saved to the VIEW&rsquo;s SD card (Destination = &lsquo;SD card&rsquo;), then the deflicker data will already be there when imported into Lightroom.  Just be careful not to change the exposure slider.  All other sliders are ok in the develop mode.</p>

<p>If the images were saved to the camera (Destination = &#39;Camera&rsquo;), then the XMPs need to be merged into the same folder as the RAW images.</p>

<p>To retrieve XMPs for clips that were saved to the camera, go to Time-lapse Clips, select the clip, then press the menu (lower right) button and select &ldquo;Write XMPs to SD card&rdquo;.  This step is necessary even if an SD card was present in the VIEW while recording to the camera.</p>

<p>For blending changes in white balance or other parameters in Lightroom (don&rsquo;t change exposure with this method, though), try Jeffrey Friedl’s &ldquo;Timelapse Support&rdquo; Lightroom plugin: <a href="http://regex.info/blog/lightroom-goodies/timelapse-support">http://regex.info/blog/lightroom-goodies/timelapse-support</a></p>

<h2 id="deflickering-during-render">Deflickering during render</h2>

<p>This is not ideal, but if you prefer to process the photos in Capture One or another program besides Lightroom, deflickering can be done on the resulting images after the initial RAW conversion.  Tools for this include GBDeflicker, TLDF, and Sequence.</p>

          <h1 id="troubleshooting-amp-support">Troubleshooting &amp; Support</h1>

<p>Hopefully your experience with the VIEW is smooth and issue-free, but should there be a problem, don&rsquo;t worry &ndash; we&rsquo;re here to help!  Reporting issues helps to improve the product for everyone, so there are some systems in place to help with this.</p>

<h3 id="sending-time-lapse-log-files-to-support">Sending time-lapse log files to support</h3>

<p>If a problem occurs during a time-lapse, sending the error log will help in quickly identifying and solving the core cause.  Here are the steps to take (firmware v1.5.0 or newer is required for this):</p>

<ul>
<li>From the main menu, go to Time-lapse Clips</li>
<li>Select the problematic clip</li>
<li>Press the menu/context button (lower right)</li>
<li>Select &ldquo;Send log for review&rdquo;, then select the general reason</li>
</ul>

<p>It will then upload the report next time it&rsquo;s connected via view.tl.</p>

<p>If you send a report, let me know more details by sending a message here: <a href="http://www.timelapseplus.com/contact/">http://www.timelapseplus.com/contact/</a></p>

<aside class="notice">NOTE: In order for log files to upload, the VIEW device must be setup for the remote app (paired with your account on app.view.tl). If you haven&rsquo;t already done this, please see <a href="#remote-internet-method">the remote app setup page</a>.  Once it&rsquo;s paired, any queued logs will be uploaded automatically.</aside>

<h3 id="trouble-with-a-particular-camera">Trouble with a particular camera</h3>

<p>First, try a different USB cable if possible &ndash; Sony cameras seem to be especially picky.</p>

<p>If a particular camera is not working, it might not be fully supported.  You can help provide the info needed for adding support by doing the following (firmware v1.5.0 or newer is required for this):</p>

<ul>
<li>Connect the camera to the VIEW</li>
<li>Go to Settings, then select &ldquo;Send camera report&rdquo;</li>
</ul>

<p>It will then take an image, gather information about the camera, and upload it via view.tl next time you&rsquo;re connected.  The image will not be sent &ndash; only the associated data and error log.</p>

<p>If you send a report, let me know more details by sending a message here: <a href="http://www.timelapseplus.com/contact/">http://www.timelapseplus.com/contact/</a></p>

<h3 id="trouble-connecting-to-wifi">Trouble Connecting to Wifi</h3>

<p>Certain firmware versions had a bug preventing wifi from connecting to certain access points depending on the name:</p>

<ul>
<li>v1.5.0 and under: would not connect to access points with an apostrophe (&rsquo;) in the name</li>
<li>v1.6.0 to v1.6.1 would not connect to access points with a unicode apostrophe (&rsquo;), space, or dash (-) in the name</li>
<li>v1.6.2 and up: should connect to all access points</li>
</ul>

<p>Also, if it fails to connect, try disabling wifi, enabling it again, then reconnecting making sure the password is correct (it&rsquo;s case-sensitive).</p>

<p>Also, if firmware updates fail to download, make sure Bluetooth is disabled in Settings-&gt;Wireless Setup, as this can sometimes cause issues.</p>
